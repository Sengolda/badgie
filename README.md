<p align="center">Badgie is the most simple way to get that sweet sweet discord active developer badge</p>

### Why was this made?

Well about a couple of months ago discord made the [discord active developer badge](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10113997751447-Active-Developer-Badge) and yes, you can read the article and make your own bot and do it. But no one wants to do that so this program makes that whole process alot easier.


### How to use

- You must have a server that you own (it does not matter how old the server is you just need a server that you created and own)
- Make a [discord bot in the discord developer portal here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Python 3.8 or higher is required [download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install or clone the repo
- After installing open the command line and run the following:


```bash
# MacOS/Linux
cd badgie
python3 -m pip install -Ur requirements.txt
python3 main.py

# Windows
cd badgie
py -3 -m pip install -Ur requirements.txt
py -3 main.py
```
The rest is done interactively
